* bonds
- debt investment to entity
- owners are called debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer.
- fixed-income securities
- used for raising money, interest rate(coupon), loaned funds(bond principal), return date(maturity date)
** Example of Bond Workings
Because fixed-rate coupon bonds will pay the same percentage of its face value over time, the market price of the bond will fluctuate as that coupon becomes desirable or undesirable given prevailing interest rates at a given moment in time. For example if a bond is issued when prevailing interest rates are 5% at $1,000 par value with a 5% annual coupon, it will generate $50 of cash flows per year to the bondholder. The bondholder would be indifferent to purchasing the bond or saving the same money at the prevailing interest rate.

If interest rates drop to 4%, the bond will continue paying out at 5%, making it a more attractive option. Investors will purchase these bonds, bidding the price up to a premium until the effective rate on the bond equals 4%. On the other hand, if interest rates rise to 6%, the 5% coupon is no longer attractive and the bond price will decrease, selling at a discount until it's effective rate is 6%.

Because of this mechanism, bond prices move inversely with interest rates.

** Characteristics of Bond
-Face value is the money bond will be worth at its maturity
-Coupon rate is rate of interest
-Coupon dates are the dates on which the bond issuer will make interest payments. 
-Maturity date is the date on which the bond will mature and the bond issuer will pay the bond holder the face value of the bond.
-Issue price is the price at which the bond issuer originally sells the bonds.
-Credit quality and duration affect the bond
-**Bond portfolios, investors typically consider the duration and [convexity](*convexity)**

** Bond Issuers
- Corporate bonds are issued by companies.
- Municipal bonds are issued by states and municipalities. Municipal bonds can offer tax-free coupon income for residents of those municipalities.
- U.S. Treasury bonds (more than 10 years to maturity), notes (1-10 years maturity) and bills (less than one year to maturity) are collectively referred to as simply "Treasuries."
